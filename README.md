finished my assignment. It took my decent amount of time, but in the end everything ,hopefully, went well.

this is my video in case of my .mp4 file wil not be opened: https://youtu.be/Jb9uJe5Gfj8.
This is my cloud deployment link (shown in video):

https://web-frigid-reverification.eu-gb.mybluemix.net/events2017/index.html

INSTRUCTIONS:

* video

* extract the contents of the file

* cd web (or filename)

* node newApp.js

and it will work on localhost:8090. I am not sure how it will recognize durham ip on local (e.g. ":ffff:127.0.0.1") but it accepts "concertina" as auth_token of durham.

If tests are not working/errors for post events/venues/add PLEASE PLEASE GET IN CONTACT WITH ME for my cloud deployment. so I will open it and enable it for you to test via postman. That is becuase it is really working, and I dont want to see it fail due to localhost limitations. :( I showed everything working in the video. (I even did my own postman, but then realized that you willl not mark that ("apart from web service" thing) )



Please forgive my english (if wrong), I was too excited. Actually I had a bit better one, but it lacked one thing that must be presented in the video. 



Thanks for everything!
